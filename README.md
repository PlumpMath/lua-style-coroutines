A super-simple "Lua-like" coroutine implementation for C++. 

To run the sample, download it and type "make."  Then run "./coroutine."

If you're interested in this, check out my [coro](https://github.com/mfichman/coro.git) library, which is much more robust and includes an asynchronous socket library.
